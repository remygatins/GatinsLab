The primer mix is suitable for the amplification of all Illumina libraries flanked by the P5 and P7 flow cell sequences. Primers are supplied at a 10X concentration of 20 μM each, and have been formulated as described below. User-supplied primer mixes may be used in combination with incomplete or custom adapters. Please contact Technical Support at sequencing.roche.com/support for guidelines on the formulation of user-supplied library amplification primers.\n• To achieve the highest amplification efficiency and avoid primer depletion, it is critical to use an optimal concentration of high-quality primers. Primers should be used at a final concentration of 0.5 – 4 μM each. For libraries constructed from ≥100 ng input DNA, a final concentration of at least 2 μM of each primer is recommended.\n• Library amplification primers should be HPLC-purified and modified to include a phosphorothioate bond at the 3’-terminal of each primer (to prevent degradation by the strong proofreading activity of KAPA HiFi HotStart). Always store and dilute primers in a buffered solution (e.g., 10mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0–8.5), and limit the number of freeze-thaw cycles. To achieve the latter, store primers at 2°C to 8°C for short-term use, or as single-use aliquots at -15°C to -25°C.\n\n5.1 Assemble each library amplification reaction as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nVolume\n1/3 Volume\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nKAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (2X)\n25 µL\n8.3 µL\n\n\n\nLibrary Amplification Primer Mix (10X)*\n5 µL\n1.7 µL\nif using custon Primers i5/i7 they should be at [20µM]\n\n\nAdapter-ligated library\n20 µL\n6.7 µL\n\n\n\n——————–\n——\n——\n——\n\n\nTotal Volume\n50 µL\n16.7 µL\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Mix thoroughly and centrifuge briefly.\n5.3 Amplify using the following cycling protocol:\n\n\n\n\nStep\nTemp\nTime\nCycles\n\n\n\n\nInitial Denaturation\n98°C\n45 sec\n1\n\n\nDenaturation\n98°C\n15 sec\n\n\n\nAnnealing\n60°C\n30 sec\n8X\n\n\nExtension\n72°C\n30 sec\n\n\n\nFinal Extension\n72°C\n1 min\n1\n\n\nHOLD\n4°C\n∞\n1\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Proceed directly to Post-amplification Cleanup (step 6).\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT- Only do this the first time and check your library.

For libraries constructed from ≥100 ng input DNA, a final concentration of at least 2 μM of each primer is recommended.\n• Library amplification primers should be HPLC-purified and modified to include a phosphorothioate bond at the 3’-terminal of each primer (to prevent degradation by the strong proofreading activity of KAPA HiFi HotStart). Always store and dilute primers in a buffered solution (e.g., 10mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0–8.5), and limit the number of freeze-thaw cycles. To achieve the latter, store primers at 2°C to 8°C for short-term use, or as single-use aliquots at -15°C to -25°C.\n\n5.1 Assemble each library amplification reaction as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nVolume\n1/3 Volume\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nKAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (2X)\n25 µL\n8.3 µL\n\n\n\nLibrary Amplification Primer Mix (10X)*\n5 µL\n1.7 µL\nif using custon Primers i5/i7 they should be at [20µM]\n\n\nAdapter-ligated library\n20 µL\n6.7 µL\n\n\n\n——————–\n——\n——\n——\n\n\nTotal Volume\n50 µL\n16.7 µL\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Mix thoroughly and centrifuge briefly.\n5.3 Amplify using the following cycling protocol:\n\n\n\n\nStep\nTemp\nTime\nCycles\n\n\n\n\nInitial Denaturation\n98°C\n45 sec\n1\n\n\nDenaturation\n98°C\n15 sec\n\n\n\nAnnealing\n60°C\n30 sec\n8X\n\n\nExtension\n72°C\n30 sec\n\n\n\nFinal Extension\n72°C\n1 min\n1\n\n\nHOLD\n4°C\n∞\n1\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Proceed directly to Post-amplification Cleanup (step 6)."
