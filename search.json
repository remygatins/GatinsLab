The primer mix is suitable for the amplification of all Illumina libraries flanked by the P5 and P7 flow cell sequences. Primers are supplied at a 10X concentration of 20 μM each, and have been formulated as described below. User-supplied primer mixes may be used in combination with incomplete or custom adapters. Please contact Technical Support at sequencing.roche.com/support for guidelines on the formulation of user-supplied library amplification primers.\n• To achieve the highest amplification efficiency and avoid primer depletion, it is critical to use an optimal concentration of high-quality primers. Primers should be used at a final concentration of 0.5 – 4 μM each. For libraries constructed from ≥100 ng input DNA, a final concentration of at least 2 μM of each primer is recommended.\n• Library amplification primers should be HPLC-purified and modified to include a phosphorothioate bond at the 3’-terminal of each primer (to prevent degradation by the strong proofreading activity of KAPA HiFi HotStart). Always store and dilute primers in a buffered solution (e.g., 10mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0–8.5), and limit the number of freeze-thaw cycles. To achieve the latter, store primers at 2°C to 8°C for short-term use, or as single-use aliquots at -15°C to -25°C.\n\n5.1 Assemble each library amplification reaction as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nVolume\n1/3 Volume\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nKAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (2X)\n25 µL\n8.3 µL\n\n\n\nLibrary Amplification Primer Mix (10X)*\n5 µL\n1.7 µL\nif using custon Primers i5/i7 they should be at [20µM]\n\n\nAdapter-ligated library\n20 µL\n6.7 µL\n\n\n\n——————–\n——\n——\n——\n\n\nTotal Volume\n50 µL\n16.7 µL\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Mix thoroughly and centrifuge briefly.\n5.3 Amplify using the following cycling protocol:\n\n\n\n\nStep\nTemp\nTime\nCycles\n\n\n\n\nInitial Denaturation\n98°C\n45 sec\n1\n\n\nDenaturation\n98°C\n15 sec\n\n\n\nAnnealing\n60°C\n30 sec\n8X\n\n\nExtension\n72°C\n30 sec\n\n\n\nFinal Extension\n72°C\n1 min\n1\n\n\nHOLD\n4°C\n∞\n1\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Proceed directly to Post-amplification Cleanup (step 6).\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT- Only do this the first time and check your library.

    "text": "The KAPA Library Amplification Primer Mix (10X) is designed to eliminate or delay primer depletion during library amplification reactions performed with KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix. The primer mix is suitable for the amplification of all Illumina libraries flanked by the P5 and P7 flow cell sequences. Primers are supplied at a 10X concentration of 20 μM each, and have been formulated as described below. User-supplied primer mixes may be used in combination with incomplete or custom adapters. Please contact Technical Support at sequencing.roche.com/support for guidelines on the formulation of user-supplied library amplification primers.\n• To achieve the highest amplification efficiency and avoid primer depletion, it is critical to use an optimal concentration of high-quality primers. Primers should be used at a final concentration of 0.5 – 4 μM each. For libraries constructed from ≥100 ng input DNA, a final concentration of at least 2 μM of each primer is recommended.\n• Library amplification primers should be HPLC-purified and modified to include a phosphorothioate bond at the 3’-terminal of each primer (to prevent degradation by the strong proofreading activity of KAPA HiFi HotStart). Always store and dilute primers in a buffered solution (e.g., 10mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0–8.5), and limit the number of freeze-thaw cycles.

Vortex well.\nPrepare an aliquot of 80% ethanol using molecular grade ethanol and molecular grade H2O. Calculate how much you’ll need by multiplying 200uL by (your number of samples + 1). For example, if you are cleaning 8 DNA samples, you will need 200*9=1800uL of 80% ethanol.\nPrepare an aliquot of your chosen elution buffer to heat to 37C (either in strip tubes if heating in thermocycler or a 1.5-2mL tube if using a heat block).\n\n\n\n\n\nCombine a volume of your DNA sample with 3x that volume of beads (ex. 100uL DNA + 300uL beads). Mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down, then vortex and spin.\nIncubate tubes/plate for 15 minutes to allow beads to bind to DNA.\nPlace tubes/plate on magnet and incubate until liquid is clear. ** Depending on the volume, this could take 5+ minutes. For example, 200uL of volume typically took about 15 mins.\nDiscard supernatant.\nOn magnet, add 100uL of 80% ethanol to each sample. If 100uL does not sufficiently cover the beads, increase this volume.\nIncubate for &gt;30 seconds, then remove and discard supernatant.\nAdd another 100uL of ethanol, incubate for &gt;30 more seconds and discard the supernatant.\nDry beads by leaving them uncapped for 3-5 minutes until all ethanol has evaporated (be careful to not over-dry beads).\nRemove plate from magnet.\nResuspend beads in elution buffer (heated to 37C) and vortex and spin. Choose your elution buffer volume by adding 5uL to your desired final volume. For example, if you want 50uL of clean genomic DNA, elute in 55uL.\nAllow samples to incubate at room temperature with caps on for 5-10 minutes (I found that 10 minutes increased yield).\nPlace tubes/plate back on magnet.\nTransfer your desired final sample volume to a final labeled set of tubes/plate.\nQuantify!",
